# Predicting-Loans-Future-Status-Classifying-Loans-with-High-Default-Risk-v.s.-High-Rewards-for-Lend
Loan is one of the most widely-used financial instrument for both individuals and institutions of various sizes. It is critical for financial institutions to understand and model credit risks, and to make proper decisions for granting loans. In this project, we are interested in applying machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting future loan status (default, late, full-paid etc.). This problem lies in the area of supervised learning, and in multi-classes classification in particular. We use the public accessible “All Lending Club loan data” from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) as our learning dataset. The data set contains 1,646,801 records of loans from 2007 to Q2 of 2018 with various purposes from mortgage to small business.
